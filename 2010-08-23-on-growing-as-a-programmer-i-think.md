I keep hoping that some day, I will look back at code I wrote over a year prior without once thinking "man, I was young and stupid back then".  That day has not arrived yet.

Perhaps I should be consoled by the fact that the reason I'm looking at these prior works now isn't because they broke in front of a customer.  This time, at least.
